## Supaplex Levelset 78 -- Canonical solutions


### Notes
All solutions (except level 88) are made by author (Kim, Min-Soo).
Solution for level 88 (78s088.mpx, probably synthesized) is by FSchindler and is canonical.

Other solutions have been found later (fastest known is by geoo89), which fit into *.sp level format constraints.

#### Author's note for level 88

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Level 88 -  WAITING FOR GODOT AGAIN  │
└───────────────────────────────────────┘
It's unable to make solution demo of this level for tremendous long time to
play. I didn't solve it for the same reason, but it's solvable theoretically.
Special feature of this level, is it's using 'hidden track'. Another Murphy
(dummy) is in hidden track, right beneath bottom-right orange disk. You should
not explode the Electron on the left side of Murphy. That will kill Murphy in
the end. You should wait all enemys move away and make room for the Zonk in
bottom-right. Also that time, you must release freezed Zonk to fall down and
activate the second 'GODOT' by passing the special port above you. It have to
be right on time, or be failed.
